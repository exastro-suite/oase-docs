External software link overview
==============================

| Exastro OASE uses alert messages as triggers amd matches the contents of the alert messages with the conditions written in the Condition tables before reacting.
| The measures applied when recieving Alert messages are decided by the Decision table. The **Link Driver** then uses the parameters defined in the :doc:`../rule_definition/action` and requests an action from the linked externam application.
| This manual explains how to use the different **Link drivers** to apply/perform actions.
