=================

| Exastro Operation Autonomy Support Engine (Exastro OASE) is a open source software developed/supported by NEC Corporation. It is a developed as an operational monitoring solution to support monitoring operators.
| In addition to having to predict and consider any troubles that might occur in advance, Operational monitoring comes with the difficulty of having its documents be individualized and disorganized, meaning that it is hard to have a leveled operation.
| Exastro OASE comes with functions created with the aim to support said operational monitoring.
| It can link to monitoring software (e.g. Zabbix Prometheus) and Automation software (e.g. Exastro IT Automation) to automate the whole process between when troubles occur to applying the solution.
| The languages used are Python and Java.
